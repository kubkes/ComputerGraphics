# **Computer Graphics Course Projects**  

This folder includes three projects that I completed for the Computer Graphics course at USC. 

Main C++ files are named as 'hwX.cpp' inside 'hwX-starterCode' folders where 

X = 1: Height Fields using Shaders  
X = 2: Simulating a Roller Coaster  
X = 3: Ray Tracer
